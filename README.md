# Gig Radio

## Listen to music by artists who are playing near you tonight.

This is website for a product being built by the Assembly community. You can help push this idea forward by visiting [https://assembly.com/gig-radio](https://assembly.com/gig-radio).

## Local workflow

1. Install jekyll `gem install jekyll`
2. `jekyll serve --watch` in the project dir

Don't edit the contents of `_site`, this is auto-generated by Jekyll.

### How Assembly Works

Assembly products are like open-source and made with contributions from the community. Assembly handles the boring stuff like hosting, support, financing, legal, etc. Once the product launches we collect the revenue and split the profits amongst the contributors.
